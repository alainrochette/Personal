Producers Angela Santomero, Todd Kessler and Traci Paige Johnson combined concepts from child development and early-childhood education with innovative animation and production techniques that helped their viewers learn. It was hosted originally by Steve Burns, who left in 2002 to pursue a music career, and later by Donovan Patton. Burns was a crucial reason for the show's success, and rumors that surrounded his departure were an indication of the show's emergence as a cultural phenomenon. Blue's Clues became the highest-rated show for preschoolers on American commercial television and was crucial to Nickelodeon's growth. It has been called \"one of the most successful, critically acclaimed, and ground-breaking preschool television series of all time\". A spin-off called Blue's Room premiered in 2004.\n\nThe show's producers and creators presented material in narrative format instead of the more traditional magazine format, used repetition to reinforce its curriculum, and structured every episode the same way. They used research about child development and young children's viewing habits that had been conducted in the thirty years since the debut of Sesame Street in the U.S. They revolutionized the genre by inviting their viewers' involvement. Research was part of the creative and decision-making process in the production of the show, and was integrated into all aspects and stages of the creative process. Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers, and resembled a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting was familiar to American children, but had a look unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999.

The series was based on the Academy Award winning short film Bob's Birthday, featuring the same main characters, which won the Best Animated Short Film Oscar in 1994. The series is one of the few Canadian TV shows to ever have regular American exposure. In Canada, it was the highest rated Canadian made animation series ever when it aired in prime time on Global Television.\n\nThe show revolved around a married English couple named Bob and Margaret Fish, a middle class 40-ish working couple with no children and two dogs named William and Elizabeth. Bob is a dentist and Margaret is a chiropodist. Bob and Margaret struggle with everyday issues and mid life crisis. Stories often revolve around the mundane, but in a way which is eminently relatable. From the trials of shopping to dealing with friends who annoy them, but owe them a dinner.\n\nIn the first two seasons, Bob and Margaret lived in England, in the South London community of Balham. For the third and fourth seasons, however, they moved to Toronto, Canada, allowing the writers to explore the humour of culture clash. The move was actually inspired by the realities of funding, with certain Canadian tax benefits dependent on stories actually based in Canada. As such, to keep the series funded, the move was necessary. The creators of the series chose to take an executive role on these latter two seasons, reviewing scripts and consulting, but not involved in the detail they were for the first two seasons. Snowden continued to provide the voice of Margaret, but Bob's voice, originally played by Andy Hamilton, was replaced by Brian George.", "popularity": 14.474, "poster_path": "/A59OJ6Q7E0CKnly9hcZxlap6D5r.jpg", "first_air_date": "1998-06-22", "name": "Bob and Margaret", "vote_average": 6.5, "vote_count": 7}, "12323": {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": null, "genre_ids": [99, 9648], "id": 12323, "origin_country": ["US"], "original_language": "en", "original_name": "Beyond Belief: Fact or Fiction", "overview": "Can you tell the difference between fact and fiction?

It featured unprecedented filming from the actual CIA headquarters.\n\nThe show was controversial regarding its exploration of current international affairs and its treatment of the ethical conflicts inherent in intelligence work. Beckner's pilot script, written in March 2001, posited a re-invented CIA tasked with a \"War on Terror\" after Osama Bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist organization plots a lethal attack on the west. The pilot was to premiere at CIA Headquarters on September 18, 2001 and set to air on CBS September 21, 2001, however, the actual 9/11 attacks convinced the network to hold the pilot and instead air a later episode. That first episode was aired later as the third episode of the first season.\n\nThe September 11, 2001 terrorist events changed the way Americans viewed topical entertainment and \"The Agency\", at the time, was one of the most topical offering on network television.

Also, he lives next door to Paula, the love of his life and the attractive girl next door. Clay Zeeman is his somewhat abusive so called \"best friend\" who won millions of U.S. dollars after he faked an accident at a taco restaurant. He has a drug-addicted ferret for a pet, and he's named Angus. Omar is his warm Indian friend, who is just as innocent as Johnny himself is. He may be even stupider on some level. The show was developed for television by Merriwether Williams, the head writer for seasons 1-4 of Spongebob Squarepants. WIlliams was also the show runner and head writer. There were seven episodes that aired over the summer of 2003, the last ending on a cliff-hanger. However, despite favorable reviews from critics, the show had very low ratings, mainly due to poor promotion and the fact that the original source material was not a huge success in the first place.

The show is hosted by former model, carpenter and veteran television personality Ty Pennington.\n\nEach episode features a family that has faced some sort of recent or ongoing hardship such as a natural disaster or a family member with a life-threatening illness, in need of new hope. The show's producers coordinate with a local construction contractor, which then coordinates with various companies in the building trades for a makeover of the family's home. This includes interior, exterior and landscaping, performed in seven days while the family is on vacation and documented in the episode. If the house is beyond repair, they replace it entirely. The show's producers and crew film set and perform the makeover but do not pay for it. The materials and labor are donated. Many skilled and unskilled volunteers assist in the rapid construction of the house.\n\nEM:HE is considered a spinoff of Extreme Makeover, an earlier series providing personal makeovers to selected individuals, which the Home Edition has now outlasted. This show displays extreme changes to help recreate someone's space. However, the format differs considerably; in the original Extreme Makeover, for instance, participants were not necessarily chosen based on any recent hardship, whereas the family's backstory is an important component of Home Edition. EM:HE also has similarities to other home renovation series such as Trading Spaces, on which Pennington was previously a key personality.", "popularity": 44.72, "poster_path": "/nM43UpAWF3Tleshq16N8vLsMhGr.jpg", "first_air_date": "2003-12-03", "name": "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition", "vote_average": 6.633, "vote_count": 45}, "5905": {"adult": false, "backdrop_path": "/1RxLviMSjFWQ6QQk2sK2ybwcjpq.jpg", "genre_ids": [18, 10759], "id": 5905, "origin_country": ["US"], "original_language": "en", "original_name": "Helen of Troy", "overview": "Paris of Troy goes to Sparta on a diplomatic mission and falls in love with Helen, the wife of King Menelaus.

Written by Alan Geoffrion, who also wrote the novel, the story is about an aging cowboy and his nephew who transport 500 horses from Oregon to Wyoming to sell them to the British Army. Along the way, their simple horse drive is complicated when they rescue five Chinese girls from a slave trader, saving them from a life of prostitution and indentured servitude. Compelled to do the right thing, they take the girls with them as they continue their perilous trek across the frontier, followed by a vicious gang of killers sent by the whorehouse madam who originally paid for the girls.\n\nBroken Trail weaves together two historical events: the British buying horses in the American West in the late 19th century and Chinese women being transported from the West Coast to the interior to serve as prostitutes. Filmed on location in Calgary, Alberta, the miniseries originally aired on American Movie Classics as its first original film.
